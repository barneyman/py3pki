# py3pki

This is a fork of https://dverslegers@bitbucket.org/dverslegers/pypki.git - https://dennis.silvrback.com/openssl-web-front-end

I use this to manage certs generated from an https://hub.docker.com/r/alpine/openssl docker i configured from the instructions at https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/introduction.html

Currently it only generates server certs ... this is a moving project
